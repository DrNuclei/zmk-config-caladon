# Custom Keyboard Caladon

After building a few keyboards for productivity and gaming, I decided to try my hand and create a custom keyboard from scratch. The goal was to create a compact keyboard for my iPad Mini/Apple Vision Pro, these devices are my go to travel workstations, depending on the environment I would either enter Spatial reality and get work done, or if it is a quick thing I will grab my iPad Mini. However both these devices are in sore need of a keyboard, and after watching Christian Selig demonstrate the posibilities of Ergogen, I lept to work.

All I need for my litttle guy, is to be compact. I have never tried split and since I refuse to use those folding membrance keyboards, split seams the next best. After that it was simply a mattter of deciding the layout and creating a case that would allow it to stack or click into each other, making it as compact as possible.

All this was a rather long way of saying I just needed to use Git for firmware and I saw the ReadMe file sooo here we are.
